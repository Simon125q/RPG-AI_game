# RPG AI Game

## Overview
This project is a Role-Playing Game (RPG) developed in Python using the Pygame module and the OpenAI API. It features dynamic dialogues and narrations generated in real-time by OpenAI's GPT models, ensuring a unique gameplay experience during each session.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Content Generation:** Leveraging the OpenAI API, the game generates unique dialogs and story narrations, making each playthrough distinct and unpredictable.
- **Built with Pygame:** Utilizes Pythonâ€™s Pygame library for managing game visuals, event handling, and media.


## Installation

To run the RPG game, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Install Pygame and openAI api via pip:
   ```
   pip install pygame
   pip install openai
   ```
3. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/RPG-AI_game.git
   ```
4. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd RPG-AI_game
   ```
5. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and insert the following line:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY='Your-OpenAI-API-Key-Here'
   ```
6. Run the game using Python:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
